## Installation

> [!Note]  
> Make sure that you are not in the **Restricted Mode**.

### Install from official plugin distribution

1. In Obsidian, open **Settings**.
2. Under **Community plugins**, click **Browse**.
3. Search for "Markwhen" and then select it.
4. Select **Install**, then enable it.

You can also find and install Markwhen plugin here: <https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=Markwhen>

### Install via BRAT

Register `https://github.com/mark-when/obsidian-plugin` in [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) to receive upcoming releases automatically before we got reviewed from Obsidian team!

### Install the plugin manually

1. Go to the repo's latest [release page](https://github.com/mark-when/obsidian-plugin/releases/latest), and download `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` (or the zip file).
2. Copy these files to your local path `[your vault]/.obsidian/plugins/markwhen/`.
3. Relaunch Obsidian, or refresh the plugin list, you will see this plugin.
4. In the plugin list, enable `Markwhen` and enjoy!

## Development

Ensure you first have Obsidian installed, and set up a development vault.

You can download and enable the [Hot-Reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) plugin in the dev vault to experience a smooth debugging workflow. Every time `main.js`, `manifest.json` or `styles.css` updates, it will trigger an auto-reload.

### Linux / MacOS developers

If the path to your vault is something other than `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault`, update `copyAssets.sh` to point to your vault's location.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:mark-when/obsidian-plugin.git
cd obsidian-plugin
npm i
npm run vite
```

### Windows developers

Since there's no watch command out-of-the-box, you can place the repo right in the dev vault config directory (i.e. `[your vault]/.obsidian/plugins/markwhen/`), and set the `outDir` to `./` in `vite.config.ts` (vite complains about this).

```cmd
cd your-dev-vault/.obsidian/plugins
git clone git@github.com:mark-when/obsidian-plugin.git markwhen
cd markwhen
npm i
npm run vite
```

> [!Note]
> The plugin id in the manifest is `markwhen`, indicating users will find their plugin under the `.obsidian/plugins/markwhen` directory if they install this plugin from official Obsidian distribution.
